# Duel 6 Reloaded

## Description
Duel 6 Reloaded is a **cross-platform open-source last-man-standing 2D multi-player game**. The game currently supports up to **15 players** that can compete in **26 arenas**. The arenas consist of solid blocks, moving platforms and water sections. Players are able to move through the environment using walking, jumping and crouching and use weapons to eliminate their opponents. There is a diverse set of **12 available weapons** that differ in shot and reload speed, shot power and splash damage. In addition players can pick up various bonuses to boost their stamina and other characteristics. The number of rounds can be specified and the game collects player **statistics** during the gameplay such as number of wins, kills or accuracy. There are negative points for comitting suicide and drowning that discourage players from performing kamikaze attacks. The game features **customizable player profiles** and **level editor**.

## History

The very first version of the game has been developed in **2002** by [Ondrej Danek](http://www.ondrej-danek.net/en/blog) as a sequel to **Duel 5** which was popular 2D deathmatch game published in a Czech computer magazine **Level**. Since then the game code has been continually improved and later open-sourced.

## Technical overview

The game is written using the following technologies:
- C++ with C++11, C++14, C++17 features
- [SDL 2](www.libsdl.org)
- OpenGL (with a stable OpenGL 1 render backend and experimental OpenGL ES 2 and OpenGL 4 backends)
- [CMake](www.cmake.org)

There is a **builtin quake-style console** that can be used to modify game aspects at runtime.

## Docker build

You can build a runnable release bundle with Docker as the only host dependency.

### Local build with Docker Compose

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml run --rm build
```

The command writes a runnable Linux release layout to `build/`, including the `duel6r` executable and the required runtime assets (`data/`, `levels/`, `profiles/`, `shaders/`, `sound/`, `textures/`).

### Manual Linux build with Docker

If you prefer not to use Docker Compose, run the Linux build container directly:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" ghcr.io/mkapusnik/duel6r-build:develop
```

### Shared Linux and Windows bundle from Docker

The release and nightly workflows build both platforms into one shared `build/` directory. Run the Linux build first to create a clean bundle, then append the Windows executable and DLLs with the cross image:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -e OUTPUT_DIR=build \
  -e CLEAN_OUTPUT_DIR=ON \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/mkapusnik/duel6r-build:develop

docker run --rm \
  -e OUTPUT_DIR=build \
  -e BUILD_TESTING=OFF \
  -e RUN_TESTS=OFF \
  -e CLEAN_OUTPUT_DIR=OFF \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/mkapusnik/duel6r-build-w64:develop
```

The final shared release bundle is `build/` with the Linux binary (`duel6r`), the Windows binary (`duel6r.exe`), Windows DLL dependencies, and one shared copy of runtime assets.

### Build image publication

The build images are published to GitHub Container Registry by the `Develop - Build Container Image` workflow whenever Docker build files change on the `develop` branch:

- `ghcr.io/mkapusnik/duel6r/build` (Linux native build)
- `ghcr.io/mkapusnik/duel6r/build-w64` (Windows x64 cross-build)

## Supported platforms

The game has been tested on the following platforms:
- **MS Windows** with Visual Studio 2017 and MinGW 64 compilers
- **Linux** with GCC 7.1 compiler
- **Mac OS X** with LLVM/Clang compiler

Recommended IDE:
- **CLion** - Duel 6 Reloaded is supported by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=Duel6Reloaded)

## Customization

The game offers several customization options

### Player profiles

Each player has its own set of **skin colors** and **sounds** for various game situations. These can be configured through **JSON files** located in player directory.

### Level editor

Levels are saved in JSON format and there is an [HTML5 level editor](https://github.com/odanek/duel6r-editor) available in my GitHub repository that can be used to create new levels and modify the existing ones.

### Scripting

The game has built-in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/home.html) scripting. More information about the API can be found in **lua-scripting.txt**.

## Future plans and milestones

- Computer opponents/bots - AI
- Network play
- Rewriting the remaining parts of original C code with global functions and variables using modern object-oriented code
- Providing extension API for weapons, players and other game attributes
- Collision detection and physics
